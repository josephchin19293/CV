[My Projects](#my-projects) | [Skills](#skills) | [Education](#education) | [Interests](#interests)

An enthusiastic Junior Web Developer and Makers Academy graduate with a sharp mind and an insatiable hunger to never stop learning. I really enjoy solving problems alongside my peers, but more than that I would love to collaborate with people using creative and functional processes to, hopefully, sculpt and build clean, test-driven code with long lasting effects on the real world! I'm looking to open my first (and certainly not my last) door into the tech industry as a developer working in a team with a similar level of camaraderie and passion in order to learn as much as I can whilst adding value to my team every step of the way.


### My Projects

#### Rails_cleaner: [repo](https://github.com/josephchin19293/rails_cleaner)

A Ruby Gem that with command line interface that deletes unused, (often) useless coffeescript and scss files that get automatically generated with Rails projects.

Written in a week by a group of 4 including myself, this project is pure Ruby.

#### Werewolves Game: [front-end repo](https://github.com/harrywynnwill/werewolves_frontend), [back-end repo](https://github.com/elibar-uk/werewolves_backend)

Built over two weeks by a group of four, this project is a Mobile app (iOS and Android) for Werewolves, an extremely popular roleplaying game in Makers Academy. Fairly logic-heavy, this [video](https://vimeo.com/101331825) gives a basic summary of the rules.

#### Technologies used:
* Rails API
* PostgreSQL database
* AngularJS
* Ionic

#### VoiceAlarm

VoiceAlarm is my current hobby project in progress - it is a mobile app that aims to wake users up in the morning with prerecorded voice notes and reminders. It is the result of a long "what would be a helpful app?"-discussion with my sister and the desire to build, experience and learn as much as I can and keep my skills honed while creating something that I'd be more than happy to use myself.

#### Technologies used:
* Ionic
* AngularJS


### Skills

#### An adaptable learner

**As a Makers Grad**
I am used to thriving in an environment that is dictated by entirely new technologies, tools, languages and concepts. Through being immersed in a high pressure environment, I have come to be extremely comfortable with the discomfort of unfamiliarity. One of my greatest strengths is my ability to constantly engage, learn and adapt.

**Previous Experience:**
Having worked in service to fund a my travel across five continents, being adaptable was possibly one of my most valuable traits. From cancelled coaches and lost valuables in Peru to asking for directions in broken Thai on motorbikes in Thailand, learning quickly and adapting to change is absolutely paramount. After two years I have grown and developed this powerful trait hugely.

#### A good communicator and pair programmer

**As a Makers Grad**, months of pair programming, stand-ups every day (sometimes even twice) and well-formed structures for instantaneous feedback are only a few of the reasons why I have been thoroughly prepared to communicate and collaborate with developers of any kind.

**Previous Experience:**
My experience in the service industry refined my verbal communication in a powerful way. I overtly aware of different ways to confront difficulty and disagreement and the most team-oriented methods in particular.

### Education

#### [Makers Academy](http://www.makersacademy.com) (Apr 16 to Jul 16)

After working through several free online coding courses and engaging my interests, I found that I am very passionate about code. I looked for the best bootcamps and courses in Chicago, New York and London before coming across Makers Academy earlier this year. 16 weeks later I am more passionate than ever and in possession of a number of core best-practices to write test-driven object-oriented code.

Skills I learned:
* Best practices in software craftsmanship: OOP, TDD, SOLID, MVC (all the acronyms)
* Working with Agile methodologies

Languages and frameworks studied:
* Ruby and Rails
* Javascript, Node.js and AngularJS
* Rspec, Jasmine, Capybara, Karma, Protractor
* PSQL, ActiveRecord
* HTML, CSS
