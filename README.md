I am an enthusiastic Junior Developer with a sharp mind and an insatiable hunger to never stop learning. As a Makers Academy and UKC Computer Science graduate, I really enjoy solving problems alongside my peers; but more than that I would love to collaborate with people using creative and functional processes to sculpt and build clean test-driven code with long lasting effects on the real world! I'm looking to open my first (and certainly not my last) door into the tech industry as a developer working within a lively team that I can contribute to and learn from in equal measure.


### My Projects

### Cleanbot: [repo]()

Cleanbot is an Alexa skill built by myself and a couple of friends that works alongside a LEGO device used to pick up objects in a room, totally hands free. It was a year-long project that combines a number of technologies to help Amazon's Alexa Natural Language Processing to convert voice commands into instructions for our LEGO bot.

#### Technologies used:
* Python (mainly)
* Amazon Dev Console
* Amazon Skills Kit
* Flask-ask
* SocketIO
* Ngrok
* Lego Digital Designer

An extension of this project which the group is currently working on is Deep Learning and Object recognition so that our Cleanbot device could have the capabilities to autonomously navigate a room collecting certain objects from the floor.

### Rails_cleaner: [repo](https://github.com/josephchin19293/rails_cleaner)

A Ruby Gem with command line interface that deletes unused and often useless coffeescript and scss files that get automatically generated with Rails projects.

Written in a week by a group of 4 including myself, this project is pure Ruby.

### Werewolves Game: [front-end repo](https://github.com/harrywynnwill/werewolves_frontend), [back-end repo](https://github.com/elibar-uk/werewolves_backend)

Built over two weeks by a group of four, this project is a Mobile app (iOS and Android) for Werewolves, an extremely popular roleplaying card game in Makers Academy. Fairly logic-heavy, this [video](https://vimeo.com/101331825) gives a basic summary of the rules. The project uses JSON to pass unique user information from the AngularJS/Ionic front-end to the Rails API back-end and PostgreSQL Database.

#### Technologies used:
* JSON
* Rails API
* PostgreSQL database
* AngularJS
* Ionic

### What's the weather?

A project that I built to familiarize myself with JavaScript, JSON and jQuery focusing on front-end, interactive web pages and alternatives to 'raw' JavaScript. The project utilizes the jQuery library to manipulate the Document Object Model along with a jQuery AJAX call to the Open Weather Map API in order to get weather information about specific cities to display to the user.

#### Technologies used:
* JavaScript
* jQuery
* JSON
* AJAX
* Open Weather Map API


### Skills

#### An adaptable learner

**As a Makers Grad**
I am used to thriving in an environment that is dictated by entirely new technologies, tools, languages and concepts. Through being immersed in a high pressure environment, I have come to be extremely comfortable with the discomfort of unfamiliarity. One of my greatest strengths is my ability to constantly engage, learn and adapt.

**Previous Experience:**
Having worked in service to fund my travels across five different continents, being adaptable is possibly one of my most valuable traits. From cancelled coaches and lost valuables in Peru to asking for directions in broken Thai on motorbikes in Thailand, I found that learning quickly and adapting to change is absolutely paramount. After two years of near constant change, I have grown and developed this powerful trait hugely.

#### A good communicator and pair programmer

**As a Makers Grad** I experienced months of pair programming, daily stand-ups and instant feedback which gave me a good head start in communicating and collaborating with an extremely diverse range of developers.

**Previous Experience:** My experience in the service industry refined my verbal communication in a powerful way. I am well versed in team-oriented methods of dealing with difficulty and disagreement, keeping in mind both the individual and the whole.

#### A problem solver

**As a Makers Grad** I had to tussle with problems on a daily basis, such as - debugging huge, unfamiliar code-bases, learning to read and understand totally unfamiliar languages and frameworks as well as designing database structures in the most efficient ways. Although occasionally very stressful, I learned that no problem is too big if you work with a method and take things one step at a time.

**Previous Experience:** Problem solving has been a huge part of my time at University. Using a variety of different languages and technologies (especially towards the final years when myself and my group of friends began to work on many more passion projects) was a core part of the problem solving I encountered. Often the barrier to using new technologies, I've found, is having the patience and grit to solve the many problems that pop up along the way - especially in setup.

### Technical Skills

**Programming Languages/Tools:** JavaScript, HTML, CSS, PostgreSQL, JSON, Ruby, Java, Erlang, OCaml, bash

**Frameworks/Libraries:** jQuery, AngularJS, Ruby on Rails, Node.js

**Software:** Microsoft Office, Terminal (Bash, zsh), Adobe Photoshop

**Other:** Git/Github, Model-View-Controller (MVC) Architectural pattern (in Sinatra, Rails and Angular)

**I'm currently in the process of teaching myself:**
* ASP.NET
* Visual basic
* PHP

### Education

#### First-Class Honours, Bachelors of Science in Computer Science - [University of Kent](https://www.kent.ac.uk/) (September 2016 to July 2019)

#### [Makers Academy](http://www.makersacademy.com) (April 2016 to July 2016)

After working through several free online coding courses and engaging my interests, I found that I am very passionate about code. I looked for the best bootcamps and courses in Chicago, New York and London before coming across Makers Academy in London earlier this year. 16 weeks later I am more passionate than ever and in possession of a number of core best-practices to write test-driven object-oriented code.

Valuable skills I gained:
* Best practices in software craftsmanship: OOP, TDD, SOLID, MVC
* Working with Agile methodologies

Languages and frameworks studied:
* Ruby and Rails
* JavaScript, Node.js, AngularJS
* Rspec, Jasmine, Capybara, Karma, Protractor
* PSQL, ActiveRecord
* HTML, CSS

#### International Baccalaureate - United World College of South East Asia, Singapore (2012-2014)

#### IGCSE - British International School of Jakarta, Indonesia (2010-2012)

### Experience

#### The Ship (July 2014 to Dec 2014)
_Server_

#### Wild Honey (January 2015 to May 2015)
_Server_

### Interests

I'm always up for trying new things, a few of my current interests are:

* Traveling
* Rugby
* Yoga
* Meditation
* Cooking
* Finding out exactly how things work - I love to tinker!
