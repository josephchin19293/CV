An enthusiastic Junior Web Developer and Makers Academy graduate with a sharp mind and an insatiable hunger to never stop learning. I really enjoy solving problems alongside my peers, but more than that I would love to collaborate with people using creative and functional processes to, hopefully, sculpt and build clean, test-driven code with long lasting effects on the real world! I'm looking to open my first (and certainly not my last) door into the tech industry as a developer working in a team with a similar level of camaraderie and passion in order to learn as much as I can whilst adding value to my team every step of the way.


### My Projects

#### [rails_cleaner](https://github.com/josephchin19293/rails_cleaner)

A Ruby Gem that with command line interface that deletes unused, (often) useless coffeescript and scss files that get automatically generated with Rails projects.

Written in a week by a group of 4 including myself, this project is pure Ruby.

#### Werewolves Game: [front-end](https://github.com/harrywynnwill/werewolves_frontend), [back-end](https://github.com/elibar-uk/werewolves_backend)

Built over two weeks by a group of four, this project is a Mobile app (iOS and Android) for Werewolves, an extremely popular roleplaying game in Makers Academy. Fairly logic-heavy, this [video](https://vimeo.com/101331825) gives a basic summary of the rules.

#### Technologies used:
* Rails API
* PostgreSQL database
* AngularJS
* Ionic

#### VoiceAlarm

VoiceAlarm is my current hobby project in progress - it is a mobile app that aims to wake users up in the morning with prerecorded voice notes and reminders. It is the result of a long "what would be a helpful app?"-discussion with my sister and the desire to build, experience and learn as much as I can and keep my skills honed while creating something that I'd be more than happy to use myself.

#### Technologies used:
* Ionic
* AngularJS


### Skills

#### An adaptable learner

**As a Maker**
I am used to thriving in an environment that is dictated by entirely new technologies, tools, languages and concepts. Through being immersed in a high pressure environment, I have come to be extremely comfortable with the discomfort of unfamiliarity. One of my greatest strengths is my ability to constantly engage, learn and adapt.
